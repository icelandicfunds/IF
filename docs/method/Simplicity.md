title: Simplicity
---
If it is too complicated, it fosters too many unknowns. No one should invest in something that cannot be understood. We like to keep it simple.

We focus on the right allocation of assets based on probability of returns and volatility, and we rebalance our investment portfolio periodically.

We ensure that investments do not become too far away from the required level of risk we have fixed.
