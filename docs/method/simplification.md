The simplest example of diversification is provided by the proverb "Don't put all your eggs in one basket".

Dropping the basket will break all the eggs. Placing each egg in a different basket is more diversified, the probability of any one basket being dropped notwithstanding. There is more risk of losing one egg (assuming at least one basket has a higher probability of being dropped than the original basket), but less risk of losing all of them.

In finance, an example of an undiversified portfolio is to hold only one stock. This is risky; it is not unusual for a single stock to go down 50% in one year. It is much less common for a portfolio of 20 stocks to go down that much, especially if they are selected at random.
If the stocks are selected from a variety of industries, company sizes and types (such as some growth stocks and some value stocks) it is still less likely.
