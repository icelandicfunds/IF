## Technology 

Technology drives our business. 

We use machine learning, distributed computing and other technologies to find connections in the world’s data. 

We work with vast sets of data, from over a thousand diverse sources. We believe that technology will play an ever increasing role in the future of active management. 

We seek to hire the very best quantitative talent to lead our research efforts and we invest in cutting edge hardware, such as GPU computing.

## Management

We’re always looking to improve our investment strategies, measuring our results as we go along. So we can make more intelligent trading decisions, with one eye on generating real alpha, and the other on effectively managing risk.

## Research

Guided by the scientific method, we devise models that begin with inspired ideas or economic hypotheses. In a systematic, process-driven fashion, models are expanded, tested and integrated into our investment strategies.
